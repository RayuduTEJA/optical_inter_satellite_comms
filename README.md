Alright, let's break down the impact of optical beam output power on inter-satellite communication. This will involve characterizing the beam, the channel, performing a power analysis, and then looking at the Bit Error Rate (BER) versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for OOK modulation.

Here's a plan, and I'll provide the Python code and explanations. You can then structure this into your GitHub repository.

**Assumptions:**

* **Laser Wavelength ($\lambda$):** 1550 nm (commonly used in optical communication due to low fiber attenuation, and it's in a relatively transparent atmospheric window, although we're in space, so the latter isn't a primary concern but a common choice).
* **Transmitter Antenna (Telescope) Diameter ($D_{tx}$):** 10 cm = 0.1 m.
* **Receiver Antenna (Telescope) Diameter ($D_{rx}$):** 20 cm = 0.2 m.
* **Optical Efficiency (Transmitter and Receiver, $\eta_{tx}, \eta_{rx}$):** Assume 80% for both.
* **Detector Responsivity ($R$):** Assume 0.8 A/W.
* **Receiver Noise Power Spectral Density ($N_0$):** Assume $10^{-15}$ W/Hz (this depends on the detector and receiver electronics; this is a reasonable order of magnitude for a sensitive receiver).
* **Data Rate ($B$):** Assume 1 Gbps = $10^9$ Hz.
* **OOK Modulation:** On-Off Keying.

**1. Characterise Optical Beam in Outer Space**

* **Beam Divergence ($\theta$):** For a diffraction-limited Gaussian beam, the far-field full-angle divergence is approximately given by:
    $$\theta \approx \frac{2 \lambda}{\pi w_0}$$
    where $w_0$ is the beam waist radius at the transmitter aperture. Assuming the beam waist is related to the transmitter aperture diameter ($D_{tx} = 2w_0$), we have $w_0 = D_{tx} / 2$. So,
    $$\theta \approx \frac{4 \lambda}{\pi D_{tx}}$$
* **Beam Radius at Distance ($L$):** The radius of the beam at a distance $L$ from the transmitter can be approximated by:
    $$w(L) \approx w_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{\lambda L}{\pi w_0^2}\right)^2} \approx \frac{\lambda L}{\pi w_0} = \frac{2 \lambda L}{\pi D_{tx}} \quad \text{for large } L$$
* **Beam Area at Distance ($L$):** The area of the beam at a distance $L$ is:
    $$A(L) = \pi w(L)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{2 \lambda L}{\pi D_{tx}}\right)^2 = \frac{4 \lambda^2 L^2}{\pi D_{tx}^2}$$
* **Intensity Profile:** Assuming a Gaussian beam, the intensity profile at a distance $L$ is given by:
    $$I(r, L) = I_0(L) \exp\left(-\frac{2 r^2}{w(L)^2}\right)$$
    where $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the beam at distance $L$, and $I_0(L)$ is the intensity at the center of the beam at distance $L$.

**2. Characterise the Channel (Outer Space)**

* **Free-Space Path Loss ($L_{fs}$):** In a vacuum, the primary loss mechanism is the spreading of the beam. The fraction of transmitted power captured by the receiver aperture is the ratio of the receiver aperture area to the beam area at the receiver distance ($L$):
    $$L_{fs} = \frac{A_{rx}}{A(L)} = \frac{\pi (D_{rx}/2)^2}{\frac{4 \lambda^2 L^2}{\pi D_{tx}^2}} = \frac{\pi^2 D_{rx}^2 D_{tx}^2}{16 \lambda^2 L^2}$$
    The path loss in dB is $-10 \log_{10}(L_{fs})$.
* **Atmospheric Attenuation:** Negligible in outer space (vacuum).

**3. Power Analysis**

* **Transmitted Optical Power ($P_{tx}$):** Given range is 100 mW to 1 W.
* **Received Optical Power ($P_{rx}$):** The power collected by the receiver is the transmitted power multiplied by the free-space path loss and the efficiencies of the transmitter and receiver optics:
    $$P_{rx} = P_{tx} \cdot L_{fs} \cdot \eta_{tx} \cdot \eta_{rx} = P_{tx} \cdot \frac{\pi^2 D_{rx}^2 D_{tx}^2}{16 \lambda^2 L^2} \cdot \eta_{tx} \cdot \eta_{rx}$$

**4. BER vs SNR for OOK Modulation**

* **Received Electrical Power ($P_{elec}$):** The photodetector converts optical power to electrical current ($I = R \cdot P_{rx}$). The electrical power developed across a load resistor (assuming a 1 Ohm load for simplicity in SNR calculation) is $P_{elec} = I^2 \cdot 1 = (R \cdot P_{rx})^2$.
* **Signal Power ($S$):** Proportional to the square of the received optical power when a '1' bit is transmitted. Let's consider the average power. For OOK, assuming equal probability of '0' and '1', the average optical power is $P_{rx}/2$. The average electrical signal power is then proportional to $(R \cdot P_{rx}/2)^2$. For simplicity in BER-SNR analysis, we'll directly use the optical SNR.
* **Noise Power ($N$):** The noise power is related to the noise power spectral density and the bandwidth: $N = N_0 \cdot B$.
* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** The electrical SNR at the receiver is approximately:
    $$SNR = \frac{(R \cdot P_{rx})^2}{N_0 \cdot B}$$
    Often, SNR is expressed in dB: $SNR_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(SNR)$.
* **Bit Error Rate (BER) for OOK:** For OOK modulation in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, the BER is given by:
    $$BER = \frac{1}{2} \text{erfc}\left(\frac{\sqrt{SNR}}{2}\right)$$
    where $\text{erfc}(x)$ is the complementary error function.

**Summary for PDF:**

**1. Introduction:**
This report analyzes the impact of optical beam output power on inter-satellite communication, considering free-space propagation and On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation.

**2. Methodology and Assumptions:**
We modeled the optical beam propagation in a vacuum, considering divergence and spread. The channel was characterized by free-space path loss. Power analysis was performed to relate transmitted and received power at various distances. Finally, the Bit Error Rate (BER) was analyzed as a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for OOK modulation. Key assumptions include the laser wavelength, transmitter and receiver telescope diameters, optical efficiencies, detector responsivity, noise power spectral density, and data rate (as specified in the Python code).

**3. Equations Used:**
* Beam Divergence: $\theta \approx \frac{4 \lambda}{\pi D_{tx}}$
* Beam Radius at Distance: $w(L) \approx \frac{2 \lambda L}{\pi D_{tx}}$
* Free-Space Path Loss: $L_{fs} = \frac{\pi^2 D_{rx}^2 D_{tx}^2}{16 \lambda^2 L^2}$
* Received Optical Power: $P_{rx} = P_{tx} \cdot L_{fs} \cdot \eta_{tx} \cdot \eta_{rx}$
* Electrical SNR: $SNR = \frac{(R \cdot P_{rx})^2}{N_0 \cdot B}$
* BER for OOK: $BER = \frac{1}{2} \text{erfc}\left(\frac{\sqrt{SNR}}{2}\right)$

**4. Results and Graphs:**

* **Transmitted Output Power vs Received Input Power:** A plot was generated showing the linear relationship between transmitted and received optical power for fixed distances of 200 km, 400 km, 600 km, 800 km, and 1000 km. As expected, the received power decreases significantly with increasing distance due to the spreading of the optical beam. The path loss dominates the power budget.

* **BER vs SNR for OOK Modulation:** Another plot illustrates the relationship between the Bit Error Rate and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (in dB) for OOK modulation at a fixed transmitted power of 200 mW and the same set of distances. The BER decreases rapidly as the SNR increases. For longer distances, the received power is lower, leading to a lower SNR and consequently a higher BER for a given SNR value on the x-axis.

**5. Key Results:**

* The received optical power is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the satellites.
* Higher transmitted power directly results in higher received power.
* Achieving a low BER requires a sufficient SNR at the receiver, which is dependent on the received optical power and the noise characteristics. For longer distances, a higher transmitted power might be necessary to maintain a desired BER.
* The free-space path loss is the primary factor limiting the communication range for a given transmitter power and receiver sensitivity.
